### Hi there 👋
Hello there! I'm Chris, hailing from the vibrant heart of France 🟦⬜🟥. My journey in the tech world began with the iconic Amiga 500, and ever since, I've been entranced by the magic of IT. My expertise lies in Linux system and network administration, and I've carved a niche for myself in the bustling realm of audiovisual events. There, I've seamlessly integrated and fine-tuned computer setups to breathe life into event automation.

Coding has been an essential chapter in my story for several years now. My weapon of choice? The RUST language, where I've honed my skills to perfection. Beyond coding, I have a fervent passion for cybersecurity, crafting clean and efficient code, and the exhilarating world of robotics. Dive into this tech odyssey with me, and let's create wonders together!
